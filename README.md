Thank you for downloading this resource! Please note I do not offer support as this was just a simple script I made since lb tablet mdt system lacked a panic button for leos.

## Supported frameworks:
* ESX
* Ox
* Qbox
* QB core

For the audio in the resource; I threw it in as it's what I use for panic button activations. You can add it by going to; lb-tablet\ui\dist\assets\sound\dispatch
